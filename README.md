Simulation Development:

Created a stochastic model to simulate disease spread within a population of 2000 individuals, incorporating variability in daily infection rates.
Implemented mechanisms to track new infections, recoveries, and deaths, providing a comprehensive view of disease dynamics over time.
Data Management:

Utilized Pandas for efficient data storage and manipulation, enabling the generation of detailed reports and statistics from simulation data.
Developed a summary table capturing daily statistics, including new cases, recoveries, deaths, and cumulative totals.
Statistical Analysis:

Calculated key metrics such as death rates, recovery rates, and progressive statistics to analyze the impact of the disease on the population.
Conducted sensitivity analysis by adjusting simulation parameters (e.g., initial infected count, death chance) to observe their effects on outcomes.
Data Visualization:

Employed Matplotlib to visualize simulation results, presenting trends in infection, recovery, and death rates for better understanding and communication of data.
